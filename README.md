# HTML Video Player

This repository contains a functional HTML5 Video Player built as part of the freeCodeCamp curriculum. It demonstrates how to embed video content with playback controls and ensure compatibility across different browsers using multiple source formats.

## Project Objective
To build a resilient video player that offers fallbacks for different file types and customized playback behavior.

## Features Implemented
* **Custom Attributes:**
    * `controls`: Enables play, pause, and volume buttons.
    * `loop`: Automatically restarts the video when finished.
    * `muted`: Starts the video without sound (often required for autoplay).
    * `poster`: Displays a custom thumbnail image before the video loads.
    * `width`: Sets a fixed display size of 640px.

* **Cross-Browser Compatibility:**
    * Includes **MP4** (`video/mp4`) for standard support.
    * Includes **WebM** (`video/webm`) for modern web performance.
    * Includes **Ogg** (`video/ogg`) for open-source efficiency.
    * Includes **QuickTime** (`video/quicktime`) for legacy Apple support.

## Technologies Used
